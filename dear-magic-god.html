<p class="cursive">Dear Magic God,</p>
<p class="drop-cap">I don&rsquo;t know if you can see us because I can&rsquo;t see you&mdash;not even with my eyes closed&mdash;so it&rsquo;s us again, powerful god, and we&rsquo;re sitting around the dinner table.</p>
<p>I was looking around just now, and it seems that the universe is in working order. Thanks for not changing things too much and letting us see the light of the star we&rsquo;re orbiting around again.</p>
<p>Thank you, magic god, for putting so much work into our meal today. Maybe you don&rsquo;t remember, but once upon a time, you spoke the first plants and animals into existence. And it was presumably you who planted, grew, and harvested all the plants in front of us too because the first time we saw them was at the supermarket. At the very least, you must have controlled the weather or bioengineered perfect seeds, because they look like they were healthy plants, oh compassionate overlord.</p>
<p>Thank you for the animal products before us, magic god. We offer them up as a sweet savor to you. Wait. You don&rsquo;t smoke meat anymore, do you? Oh, well. More for us.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice we don&rsquo;t have any of your unapproved food and beverages on our table. I hope that makes you happy, &rsquo;cause you like to make me happy when I make you happy. I know that sounds kinda <em>quid pro quo</em>, but that&rsquo;s how you work, right?</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you for all your hard work that made this meal possible, magic god. And please, magic god, enchant the hands of the lowly people who prepared this meal so that they will make more food for us in the future.</p>
<p>Now, magic god (I know I keep saying your name; I&rsquo;m just making sure you&rsquo;re paying attention to me, plus it feels good to keep reminding myself that you&rsquo;re real), we ask you&mdash;we beg you&mdash;we implore you&mdash;we beseech you&mdash;we command you&mdash;I mean, we use our most special, perfectly worded incantation to make this food magic. Please imbue it with more nutrition and energy than it already has and make it taste even better than it already does.</p>
<p>Now, dear magic god, we aren&rsquo;t sure if you&rsquo;ve heard about the terrible things that are happening in the world. Please hold back just a little on the disasters, starvation, and illness that are plaguing innocent people in the world, and please don&rsquo;t let any of these bad things happen to us. We know you&rsquo;re behind it all because in the beginning, you created viruses, bacteria, the weather, and tectonic plates. At least we know that you can stop it because you&rsquo;re all-powerful, right? But, you know, thy will be done... I&rsquo;m not really telling you what to do&mdash;just asking. And we know that you won&rsquo;t give us more than we can handle, except when we have mental breakdowns or ... die.</p>
<p>It makes us really uncomfortable to think that our dietary, financial, or energy choices might be causing anything bad to happen to other people, but if we <em>are</em> responsible for some of the suffering in the world, please make it more convenient and cheaper for us to help them&mdash;maybe let some sick, poor, and hungry people interrupt us right now so that we know you want us to help them.</p>
<p>And please heal everybody we love who is sick. People get better all the time with help from doctors and with no help at all, but you can do it faster than that because it says you did it in the Bible and in stories we&rsquo;ve heard since we were little and at those televangelism events.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re at it, please make us and everybody else forget about all the things we have ever done that you didn&rsquo;t want us to do, &rsquo;cause remembering our mistakes makes us uncomfortable. And please don&rsquo;t punish us for all the ways we break your rules; we&rsquo;d hate to experience the fullness of your wrath. I have to say this often because I make mistakes all the time, and you don&rsquo;t know how I feel about them because you can&rsquo;t read my thoughts or anything.</p>
<p>Now, magic god, please keep the leaders of your chosen church&mdash;you know, the one we belong to&mdash;happy, healthy, and rich. I mean, we know you&rsquo;re going to let them die eventually, but please make them feel good about being our leaders and taking our money and doing you-know-what with it, and please make sure they don&rsquo;t lie to us about what you tell them. But please tell them to make it a little easier for us because following all their rules is super hard.</p>
<p>We humbly acknowledge that we don&rsquo;t have a lot of self-control over what we think about or do, so please control our minds&mdash;just a little bit (we know how you feel about agency and stuff)&mdash;so that we will, with a smile, do and think only the things that make us fit into the molds prepared for us by our parents, our aged leaders, and our even older instruction books, even though they all seem pretty inconsistent to me, but like I just said, we can&rsquo;t trust our thoughts about these things because your enemy might be telepathically controlling our minds. (Dang, that guy&rsquo;s crafty.) It might be nice if you could teach us directly what you want us to do instead of talking to us through our feelings and other people, because they aren&rsquo;t very reliable. I know... you like to be confusing and mysterious too; we just don&rsquo;t want you to punish us forever for doing things that you don&rsquo;t approve of, and we really want to see our families after we die.</p>
<p>We know you hate it when we don&rsquo;t brag about your Jewish half-blood child when we talk to you, magic god (plus, what would everyone else think?), so thanks for allegedly raping his mom and helping him perform miracles that weren&rsquo;t enough to convince most people of his divinity. Thanks for making him suffer so that we don&rsquo;t have to (even though we still do). Thanks for letting those other nonbeliever Jews kill him, and thanks for apparently putting him in a coma for three days to make up for all the lepers, murderers, whores, black people (wait; you&rsquo;re on better terms with them now, aren&rsquo;t you?), atheists, illegals, climate change advocates, gentiles, homosexuals, and other people that we like to call worldly. We still love them, but we have judged them and found them to be lacking when we measure them against your version of morality, so we might condescend to them just a little. We know they&rsquo;re your children too, but you made them weaker than us, and for that, we your chosen people thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked for a lot of these things every day for many years, and I hope you&rsquo;ll eventually bless us with some of them. I hope today will be the day&mdash;I hope, I hope, I hope.</p>
<p>We love you, magic god, and we know you love us, but I think you don&rsquo;t listen very well when I don&rsquo;t end my prayers right, so I end this prayer with an incantation that contains your illegitimate child&rsquo;s alleged name and a Hebrew word that means &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ll say it differently, and it might mean something else:</p>
<p class="cursive">Jesus Christ!</p>
<p class="cursive">Amen</p>
